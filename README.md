# Email_Spam_Prediction
A machine learning-based project to classify emails as spam or not spam (ham) using natural language processing techniques and classification algorithms. The project utilizes a labeled dataset of email texts and applies a variety of preprocessing, vectorization, and classification steps to build a predictive model.

# Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop an intelligent spam filter that can accurately detect and classify email messages into spam or ham. It aims to:
Clean and process raw email text data.
Apply ML techniques and convert text into numerical form.
Train a classification model to predict whether an email is spam or not.
Evaluate and validate the model performance.
